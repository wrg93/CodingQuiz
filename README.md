# CodingQuiz
I attempted this project via a few different methods. In it's most recent iteration(index2.html,script3.js), in order to more fully explore the possibilities of DOM manipulation I made no alterations to the basic HTML frame other than linking my JavaScript file and the JQuery CDN link.

I attempted to use as little JQuery as possible but there were a few functions I had in mind that ended up being too clumsy with vanilla JS. Namely, I created an on click event for all buttons as well as on click events for classes.

I am submitting my project in the 11th hour (literally) but will continue to edit it. With just 25 minutes before the deadline I just finished the functionality of the project and am now turning back to edit style and text content.
